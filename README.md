# tulipac: The TuLiPA compiler

[TuLiPA](https://sourcesup.cru.fr/tulipa/) is the TÃ¼bingen Parsing Architecture. 
It is an excellent parser
for teaching [tree-adjoining grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-adjoining_grammar),
except that it assumes an XML
format for TAG grammars that is really complicated to work
with. 

Tulipac, the TuLiPA grammar compiler, fixes this problem by
providing a front-end that compiles TAG grammars in a human-readable
format to the XML format assumed by TuLiPA.
